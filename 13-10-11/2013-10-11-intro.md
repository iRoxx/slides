Heard of RailsRumble? The Rails Rumble is a distributed programming competition where teams of up to 4 people, from all over the world, will have 48 hours to build an innovative web application with Ruby on Rails, or another Rack-based Ruby web framework. After the 48 hours are over (and a brief interim to review submissions), a panel of expert judges will each pick his or her 10 favorite entries. All of the expert picks will be combined to find the top 10 Overall Winners, ranked 1 through 10. In addition, voting will be opened to the public for a special, separate, Public Favorite award.

In other words: as our vienna.rb team (if we can create one) will definitely win, we can win some serious props here!!

You'll find the rules here:

Let me know if you'd like to participate and we'll figure out a location and get us some COOKIES! Registration CLOSES on the 13th, so RSVP in time and we will list you guys and ladies as a team (or multiple teams).
